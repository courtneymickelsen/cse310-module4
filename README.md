# Overview

I created this program to get an introduction to the C++ language. I wanted to learn the proper syntax for the basics (variables, functions, classes, etc.), as well as learn a bit of file handling.

I wrote a program to record transactions for a small business to use to track expenses. You can add transactions and amounts, as well as view transactions from the file based on day, month, or year.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using Apple's XCode, and I programmed it in the C++ language. I used the fstream library for file handling.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to add support for deleting transactions. This would involve searching each line, and removing lines that match the remove value.
* This doesn't happen often, but sometimes I get a bug where the menu doesn't accept user input and it just keeps looping. I'd like to figure that out.
* I'd also like to update it so that the user doesn't have to end the program in order to save the added transactions to the file and view them.
